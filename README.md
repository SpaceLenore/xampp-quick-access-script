# XAMPP quick access script for linux

Starting, stopping and even accessing the GUI for XAMPP on linux is not the most convenient thing on earth. This script aims to solve that problem by simplifying the steps. Simply run it with one of the following parameters:

 * Start
 * Stop
 * GUI
 
 I do realise that this is a slightly useless script and that you could just use alias.

### Install
Download the script from here. Add an alias in your .bashrc for ease of use.


Example of alias command to put in .bashrc:  
``` alias webserver="./webserver.sh" ```
